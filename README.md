## About Me
I am a student at the University of Missouri - Columbia studying Computer Science. I am a member of the Mizzou Robotics Club and I am currently working on a project to create a robot that can navigate a maze. I am also a member of the Mizzou Game Developers Club and I am working on a project to create a game using the Unity game engine. I am interested in software development and I am always looking for new projects to work on. I am currently learning C++ and I am working on a project to create a text-based adventure game. I am also learning Python and I am working on a project to create a program that can solve Sudoku puzzles. I am interested in artificial intelligence and I am working on a project to create a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits. I am also interested in web development and I am working on a project to create a website for a local business. I am always looking for new projects to work on and I am excited to see what the future holds.
